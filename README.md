- [ ] Restructure all the code once the exploration of functionalities is finished
- [ ] Think about an efficient state management according to the needs of the project
- [ ] Abstract MovableBox so that other components can extend from it
- [ ] Research about the InteractiveViewer widget
- [ ] Create an abstraction of each movable component (Coordinates, Type of component, Characteristics, etc.)
